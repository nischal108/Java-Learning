GETTING INTO OPPS WORLD 

An object in Java is the physical as well as a logical entity, whereas, a class in Java is a logical entity only.

=> "An object is a runtime entity" means that an object exists and has a tangible presence during the execution of a program. It comes to life when the program is running and can be manipulated and interacted with at that time. Objects encapsulate data and behavior, and their instantiation and manipulation occur dynamically during the runtime of a program.



A class in Java can contain:

Fields
Methods
Constructors
Blocks
Nested class and interface


=>A variable which is created inside the class but outside the method is known as an instance variable.


=>   The new keyword is used to allocate memory at runtime. All objects get memory in Heap memory area.




3 Ways to initialize object
Initializing an object means storing data into the object. 
There are 3 ways to initialize object in Java.

         By reference variable     s1(an instance).property = ""
         By method    we create an method in the class that gets invoked to the created object which is used to intialize that particular obj.
         By constructor



reference variable refers to the object allocated in the heap memory area. since the name 
of the object is just an reference to the object that is actually created in the heap memory.





Anonymous simply means nameless. An object which has no reference is known as an anonymous object. It can be used at the time of object creation only.

If you have to use an object only once, an anonymous object is a good approach. 

new Calculation();//anonymous object  
Calculation object = new Calclation(); //genral object



There are many ways to create an object in java. They are:

By new keyword
By newInstance() method
By clone() method
By deserialization
By factory method etc.
