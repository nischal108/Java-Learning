 3 variable types in java ->local, instance and static.

->A variable declared inside the body of the method is called local variable

->A variable declared inside the class but outside the body of the method, is called an instance variable. It is not declared as static.
It is called an instance variable because its value is instance-specific and is not shared among instances.
they exist as long as the instance exists.

->A variable that is declared as static is called a static variable. It cannot be local. You can create a single copy of the static variable and share it among all the instances of the class. 
Static variables are created when the class is loaded into memory and exist as long as the program is running. They are destroyed when the program terminates.
public class Example {
    static int staticVar; // Static variable
}





 2 data types in java -> primitive( byte short int long char boolean double float) & non- primitive ( classes, interfaces, arrays)

 // java uses unicode system.
